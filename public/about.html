<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name Is Omozee Osasenaga. I am a 500L student of the department of Mechatronics Engineering In the University of Benin.
I am 23 years old, I live with my mum and siblings in Benin City, Edo State.</p>
   
<p>As an aspiring fullstack software developer currently undergoing Dr. Angela Yu's complete 2024 web development bootcamp, I 
must say the experience so far has been awesome. Learning a whole bunch of stuff from html to react and several frame works, the 
experience has been a bit overwhelming and the major challenge is keeping the motivation high. It gets difficult sometimes and 
I feel like giving up but then I remember why I'm doing this in the first place and I picture where I wanna see myself in the next 
six months. That's all the motivation I need to go forward.</p>

<p>My life goals includes owning a tech company, building and selling robotic machines, developing softwares, reaching out to millions
of lives and bringing the gospel of truth to them because everyone needs to know about Jesus!</p>
